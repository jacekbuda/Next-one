            <p>
                So, what can I say about that... lemme think. I keen on skiing, 
                probably it's my favourite activity ;) Also I love playing ( and 
                watchin') volleyball and basketball. But of course I am not such&nbsp; a
                sport person as it could look ;) I'm pretty lazy, sarcastic and 
                ( in my opinion)a little dumb xF. What's more I'm interested in 
                computers ( &lt;3 ), games of course and I'm tryin', as I said 
                before, learn sth new. Anime and manga, fantasy books are also 
                my things.

                My fav game at this time is Leuge of Legends which belongs 
                to kind of MOBA games. I usually play on Midlane, sometimes
                in the jungle xF. My beloved champ is Yasuo ( cancered ).
                I tryin' to do my best ;) FPS and MMO RPG, that's what I

                I listen to very various types of music. House, Electro
