                        ... Jacek. That's my name. I know, awesome ! I live in Nowy Sącz. 
                        It's pretty small city on the south of Poland. YES, I'm from 
                        Poland . Also I am a student one of the best

                        school in Poland</abbr>... so coooool :/ This page which I've made, is only 
                        a exercise for me. I trying to learn sth about HTML, CSS so far.

                        So, what can I say about that... lemme think. I keen on skiing, 
                        probably it's my favourite activity ;) Also I love playing ( and 
                        watchin') volleyball and basketball. But of course I am not such&nbsp; a
                        sport person as it could look ;) I'm pretty lazy, sarcastic and 
                        ( in my opinion)a little dumb xF. What's more I'm interested in 
                        computers ( &lt;3 ), games, of course and I'm tryin', as I said 
                        before, learn sth new.<br>
                        Did I mention about games ? YEP, At this time my favourite one 
                        is Leauge of Legends:<br>
                        Position: Midlane or jungle<br>
                        Favchamp: probably Yasuo ( it's cancered xF)<br>
