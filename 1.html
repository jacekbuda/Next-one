                        ... Jacek. That's my name. I know, awesome ! I live in Nowy Sącz. 
                        It's pretty small city on the south of Poland. YES, I'm from 
                        Poland . Also I am a student one of the best

                        is only a exercise for me. I trying to learn sth about HTML, CSS so far.

                        So, what can I say about that... lemme think. I keen on skiing, 
                        probably it's my favourite activity ;) Also I love playing ( and 
                        watchin') volleyball and basketball. But of course I am not such&nbsp; a
                        sport person as it could look ;) I'm pretty lazy, sarcastic and 
                        ( in my opinion)a little dumb xF. What's more I'm interested in 
                        computers ( &lt;3 ), games of course and I'm tryin', as I said 
                        before, learn sth new. Anime and manga, fantasy books are also 
                        my things.

                        My fav game at this time is Leuge of Legends which belongs 
                        to kind of MOBA games. I usually play on Midlane, sometimes
                        in the jungle xF. My beloved champ is Yasuo ( cancered ).
